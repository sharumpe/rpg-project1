# First RPG Project

I'm trying to learn a bunch of things about using RPG Maker MV, and so this project is just going to be a not-necessarily-coherent game that will help me do that.  If you're looking at this and are not me, don't expect too much.

However, since everything is javascript, json and images, it seemed useful to make it a git repo.
